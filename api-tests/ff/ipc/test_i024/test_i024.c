    * This test checks for the PROGRAMMER ERROR condition for the PSA API. API's respond to
    * PROGRAMMER ERROR could be either to return appropriate status code or panic the caller.
    * When a Secure Partition panics, the SPE cannot continue normal execution, as defined
    * in this specification. The behavior of the SPM following a Secure Partition panic is
    * IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED- Arm recommends that the SPM causes the system to restart in
    * this situation. Refer PSA-FF for more information on panic.
    * For the cases where, SPM cannot capable to reboot the system (just hangs or power down),
    * a watchdog timer set by val_test_init can reboot the system on timeout event. This will
    * tests continuity and able to jump to next tests. Therefore, each test who checks for
    * PROGRAMMER ERROR condition, expects system to get reset either by SPM or watchdog set by
    * the test harness function.
    *
    * If programmed timeout value isn't sufficient for your system, it can be reconfigured using
    * timeout entries available in target.cfg.
    *
    * To decide, a reboot happened as intended by test scenario or it happended
    * due to other reasons, test is setting a boot signature into non-volatile memory before and
    * after targeted test check. After a reboot, these boot signatures are being read by the
    * VAL APIs to decide test status.
