# Protected Storage Test Suite

## Common tests
Since Protected Storage(PS) and Internal Trusted Storage(ITS) APIs shares the similar API prototypes and return values, some of the ITS tests are reused for PS also. The reused tests are available with ``test_s[x]`` (where, x= test_num) directory name syntax in protected_storage/. The source code of these tests are located in internal_trusted_storage/ dir with same test name.
