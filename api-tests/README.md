# PSA APIs Architecture Test Suite

## Introduction

Arm *Platform Security Architecture* (PSA) is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. PSA provides a recipe, based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a hardware and firmware level. One of the PSA goals is to make IoT security easier and quicker for everyone. This means having reliable, consistent APIs and useful built-in security functions for device manufacturers and the developer community. These PSA APIs provides a consistent developer experience, hiding the underlying complexity of the security system.

## Architecture test suite

The current implementation of the architecture test suite contains tests for PSA Firmware Framework and PSA Functional APIs specifications. The tests are available as open source. The tests and the corresponding abstraction layers are available with an Apache v2.0 license, allowing external contribution.

### PSA Firmware Framework (PSA-FF)
The test suite for this specification is located in the **ff** directory of this repository. See the [PSA Firmware Framework README](ff/README.md) file for more details.

### PSA Functional APIs
The test suite for this specification is located in the **dev_apis** directory of this repository. See the [PSA Functional APIs README](dev_apis/README.md) file for more details.

## License

Arm PSA test suite is distributed under Apache v2.0 License.
