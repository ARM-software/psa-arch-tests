# Porting Guide: ADAC Test Suite
-----------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
The ADAC test suite contains the **Platform Abstraction Layer** (PAL) which abstracts platform-specific information from the tests. You must implement and port the PAL interface functions to your host platform.

This document provides the porting steps and the list of PAL APIs.

## Porting steps

### Adding a new target

  1. Create a new directory in **platform/hosts/<platform_name>**. For reference, see the existing platform **musca_b1** directory.
  2. Execute `cp -rf platform/hosts/musca_b1/ platform/hosts/<platform_name>/`.
  3. Create the link layer directory for each link layer you want to support for your platform.
  4. Update **platform/<platform_name>/<link_layer>/CMakeLists.txt** appropriately to select the correct instances of PAL files for compilation.
  5. Port the list of PAL APIs referenced in the **List of PAL APIs** section for your target platform. These API definitions are available in **platform/common/include/pal_interfaces.h** and are written for the hardware target **musca_b1**. You can reuse the code if it works for your platform. Otherwise, you must port them for your platform-specific peripherals.
  6. Provide the path to the key and certificate chain that points to the host credentials in main.c as command-line arguments. You can provide debug link layer-specific parameters as additional command-line arguments.

## List of PAL APIs
Since the test suite is agnostic to various system platforms, you must port the following PAL APIs before building the tests. Implement these functions for your host platform. <br/>
