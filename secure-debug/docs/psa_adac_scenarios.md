| Scenario ID | Section    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Test Cases |
|-------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| S_ADAC_001  | Commands   | Verify that the following commands are recognized by the target and do not return SDP_INVALID_COMMAND status.<br />1. Discovery<br/>2. Authentication Start<br\>3. Authentication Response<br/>4. Close Session<br/>5. Lock Debug<br/> | TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_002  | Commands   | Send two authentication start commands back-to-back and verify that the challenge vector obtained in the response is different. | test_a001 <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_003  | Commands   | Use discovery command to query the target for supported response fragment formats. Check that the following response fragments are supported: <br\>1. 0x200 token_adac<br\>2. 0x201 cert_adac<br\>| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_004  | Commands   | Issue invalid response fragment as part of Authentication response and check that the target responds with SDP_FAILURE status.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_005  | Commands   | Issue a different command after starting the Authentication response command and check that the target responds with SDP_FAILURE status. | TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_006  | Commands   | Verify that for a multiple fragment Authentication response request, the device responds with a SDP_MORE_DATA_NEEDED status code after each response fragment.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_007  | Commands   | Check that the Close Session command always returns a SDP_SUCCESS status.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_008  | Constraints| Provide a leaf certificate before a root certificate and verify that an error response is generated by the target.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_009  | Constraints| Check that a certificate is rejected due to each of the following scope-limiting feature:1. Role<br/>2. Lifecycle<br/>| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_010  | Constraints| Check that if two or more distinct non-neutral values are present in the certificate chain, a failure response is obtained.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_011  | Constraints| Request a permission value (perm_req) via authentication token which is denied due to a restrictive perm_mask field. Check that the authentication response is successful.| TBD <br/>  |
| S_ADAC_012  | Constraints| Request access to software partition with no software partition ID listed in the certificate chain. Check that success status is reported.| TBD <br/>  |
