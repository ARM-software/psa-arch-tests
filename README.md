## Introduction

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. PSA provides a recipe, based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a hardware and firmware level.

## Architecture test suite

The current implementation of the Architecture test suite contains tests for the TBSA-v8m specification. Arm licensees may contact their partner manager to obtain a copy of this specification. <br />

Future versions of the test suite will be enhanced to include tests for other specifications of the Platform security architecture.

The tests are available as open source. The tests and the corresponding abstraction layers are available with an Apache v2 license allowing for external contribution.

### TBSA-v8m
The test suite for this specification is located in the tbsa-v8m directory of this repository. See [TBSA-v8m Readme](tbsa-v8m/README.md) file for more details.
