
# Arm Platform Security Architecture : Test Suite


## Introduction

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. PSA provides a recipe, based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a hardware and firmware level.

### PSA APIs specifications

PSA APIs reference header files are located at [api-specs](api-specs/) directory.

### PSA Functional API Certification
The [PSA Functional API tests](api-tests/dev_apis) are the basis for getting the PSA Functional API Certification. For more information on the certification program, see [psacertified.org](https://www.psacertified.org/functional-api-certification/) 

## GitHub branch
  - For functional API certification, use the release branch and pick the appropriate release tag.
  - To get the latest version of the code with bug fixes and new features, use the master branch.
  
## Architecture test suite

The current implementation of the Architecture test suite contains tests for following PSA specifications. Arm licensees may contact their partner manager to obtain a copy of this specification. <br />

Future versions of the test suite will be enhanced to include tests for other specifications of the Platform Security Architecture.

The tests are available as open source. The tests and the corresponding abstraction layers are available with an Apache v2 license allowing for external contribution.
